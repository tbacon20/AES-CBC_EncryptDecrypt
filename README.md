# AES-CBC_EncryptDecrypt

This program can be used to encrypt / decrpyt messages or files using AES / CBC encryption techniques.

To replicate the pdf read/write functionality, create a new class called "FilePath.cs" with a public string variable indicating the path to the encrypted file. 
This path should begin after "C://Users/username/" such as "path/to/file.pdf"
